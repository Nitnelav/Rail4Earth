# Dashboard website

This frontend website is displaying the state and data of the sensor network.

It is linked to an elastic-search instance that store and index the files
generated by zero_*.py services.

This website and the backend is easily deployed if you are using the docker 
services described in [ansible_openvpn](../ansible_openvpn) folder.

# Build and run image to container

```shell
sudo docker build ./ -t dashboard && sudo docker run -p "8080:80" -v ./app/:/home/dashboard/app/ dashboard
```

Then open localhost:8080 in browser

Without having to rebuild the image or restarting the container, all changes made in files will be automatically applied
